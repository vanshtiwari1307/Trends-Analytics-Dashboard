Comparative Analysis: Evaluate keyword popularity over different time frames.<br>
Rising & Top Keywords: Discover emerging and top-performing search terms.<br>
Regional Insights: Dive into trends across various countries for a global perspective.<br>
<br>
🛠Tools Used:<br>
- Power BI <br>

🎯 Power BI at Work: Advanced Analytics with Parameters & Slicers<br>
One of the most powerful aspects of this dashboard is its interactive filtering capabilities! Using Power BI’s parameters & slicers, users can:<br>
🔹 Filter by Keyword, Category, or Region for tailored insights.<br>
🔹 Compare multiple search terms side by side.<br>
🔹 Adjust time ranges to track both short- and long-term trends.<br>
